Tiny little python thing I did so my Github profile doesn't remain as empty as a 10:30am Wednesday bus ride. It works on Debian and derivatives.

## Usage

Open the terminal on the directory the py file is. You can use:
 `cd /the/path/you/put/the/file`

Then execute it: 
 `python3 goodbye_world.py`
