Tiny little python thing I did so my Github profile doesn't remain as empty as a 10:30am Wednesday bus ride. Should work on Windows, Linux desktop systems and MacOS.

## Usage

Open the terminal on the directory the py file is. You can use:
```
cd /the/path/you/put/the/file`
```

Then execute it:
```
python3 goodbye_world.py
```
